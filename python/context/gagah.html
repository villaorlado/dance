<i>Gagah</i> means vigorous and it corresponds to one of the main subdivisions of character types, the other one being <i>halus.</i> In this particular video and data, we show the <i>kambeng kinantan</i>[refined virgorous] subvariety of <i>gagah.</i> Although we are using <i>gagah</i> for easy identification, but it should be noted that the <i>raksasa</i> and <i>wanara</i> characters are also part of the <i>gagah</i> type. Examples of <i>gagah</i> characters in Sendratari Ramayana are Indrajit, Wibisana  and Prabujanaka. In <i>wayang wong,</i> examples include Duryudana and Antareja.
