<i>Lanyap</i> is a subvariety of the <i>halus</i> character type. It is more vigorous than the <i>luruh</i> character subvariety. In the Yogyakarta tradition, this character is most often called <i>branyak</i> but our primary informant used the name <i>lanyap</i>, which is most commonly associated with the Surakarta tradition. This is not entirely unusual since <i>Sendratari Ramayana</i> dance uses elements from both the Yogyakarta and the Surakarta traditions.
