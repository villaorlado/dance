<i>Raksasa</i> means "giant" and it is a subvariety of <i>gagah.</i> When <i>raksasa</i> characters stand up, their hands are extended into the <i>bapang</i> posture, which means "to stretch the arms out to the sides". See Brakel-Papenhuijzen, Clara. <i>Classical Javanese Dance: The Surakarta Tradition and Its Terminology,</i> Leiden: KITLV Press, 1995, p.72. The motions in this page correspond to the named <i>raksasa</i> characters, such as Kumbakarna and Rahwana in <i>Sendratari Ramayana.</i> Unnamed <i>raksasa</i> characters tend to move in improvised motions that don't completely fit the character type conventions.
