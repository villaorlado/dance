<i>Wanara</i> means monkey. The simian characters come in many varieties and they are a subset of <i>gagah.</i> A <i>Sendratari Ramayana</i> example of a refined <i>wanara</i> character (such as the one in this video and data) is Hanoman. Other <i>wanara</i> characters include Subali, Sugriwa, Anggada and Anila. Not all of these characters are represented in <i>Sendratari Ramayana,</i> but the 19th century <i>Langen Mandra Wanaran<i> features a wide variety of monkey characters. This form is now rarely performed.
