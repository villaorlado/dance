<i>Luruh</i> means "extremely refined", and it is a subtype of the <i>halus</i>[refined] characters. Examples of <i>luruh</i> characters in Sendratari Ramayana are Rama and Laksmana. When they first enter the stage, the musical accompaniment is usually in <i>irama 2</i>, a slightly slower rhytmic pattern than the one used for <i>gagah</i> characters. In <i>wayang topeng</i>, an example of a <i>luruh</i> character is Panji Asmorobangun.
