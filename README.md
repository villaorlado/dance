# Biomechanical analysis of Javanese

This is a collaboration between [Miguel Escobar Varela](http://miguelescobar.com) and Luis Hernández Barraza). It consists of an interactive portal that uses biomechanical measurements (such as range of motion) to analyze differences among character types in Javanese dance. Character typology is a central concept in Javanese dance discourse and this project aims to bring together a biomechanical analytical toolkit and Javanese intellectual traditions of dance scholarship.

A paper detaling the project and finding is available at
